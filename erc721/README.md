# ERC721

This contract implements the ERC721 standard.
It allowes for the creation of so called non fungible tokens, or NFT's.
The difference of NFT's to other token standards like ERC20 or ERC777 is that each token is unique and not interchangable.


## Getting started

### Run tests

```bash
$ truffle test --network ganache
```
